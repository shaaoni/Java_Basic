Program(software):
prgram is a set of instruction that tell a computer what to do.
= we use programs to interact/ talk with computers.
= to write programs we use programming languages.

Programing languages:
it is a language that is used to write programs. 
-- We know computers are machines and they do not understand human languages.
-- Programs are written in a language a computer can understand which is called a programming language.

Machine Laanguage:
1. It is a computer's native language in which computer can understand any instruction. 
2. it uses 0 and 1 --> Binary language.
3. in machine language an instruction of adding 2 and 3 will be : 1101101010011010
which is very hard to write by human.
4. Machine language is machine dependent. Means  it differs among different types of machine.
5. All instruction written in other programing language.

Assembly language:
1. It was developed to make a programming easier.
2. It was machine dependent.
3. Keywordslike add, sub were introduced.
4. to add 2 and 3 and get the result the instruction will be: add,2,3,result.
5. "Assembler" is a program that translates assembly code with machine code.

Assembler:

High-level language:
1. It is a new generation of programing languages.
2. This language uses english words that's why it is easy to learn and easy to use.

4. this language is machine independent.
5. program will run on different machine.
6. Instructions are called "statements".
7. A program written using a high level programing language is called a 'source program' or 'source code'.

Compiler:
1. Compiler translates all the source code into machine code.
2. source program -> executable source code --compiler -> Machine code -- Executor -> output.

Interpreter:
1. translates each statement into machine code and executes it right away.

About Java:
1. It was developed at Sun Microsystems which was purchased by Oracle in 2010.
2. It is a General-purposed & powerful programing language.
3. Used for developing software that run on mobile, desktop and servers.
4. Machine independent.

API:
1. Fullform: Application Programming Interface
2. Also known as a 'Library'.
3. It contains predefined Java code that we can use to develop Java programs.
4. So, it is faster and easier development process and there is no need to write everything from scratch.

Editions of Java:
1. Java Standard Edition(SE): Development applications that run on desktop.
2. Java Enterprise Edition(EE): develop server-side applications.
3. Java Micro Edition(ME): develop applications for mobile devices.

JDK:
1. Fullform: Java Development Kit.
2. Set of programs that enable us to develop our programs.
3. contains JRE(Java Runtime Environment) that is used to run our programs.
4. JRE & JDK contain JVM(java virtual machine).
5. JVM executes our java programs on different machines. means java is          independent.

IDE:
1. Integrated development evironment.
2. where we write our source code.
3. then the code is compiled to translate the code into a machine code.
4. ide has a tool called debug which is used to find errors.
5. ide has a tool that can build files which can be executed by JVM
6. ide has tools called run that executes the program.
