Program(software):
prgram is a set of instruction that tell a computer what to do.
= we use programs to interact/ talk with computers.
= to write programs we use programming languages.

Programing languages:
it is a language that is used to write programs. 
-- We know computers are machines and they do not understand human languages.
-- Programs are written in a language a computer can understand which is called a programming language.

Machine Laanguage:
1. It is a computer's native language in which computer can understand any instruction. 
2. it uses 0 and 1 --> Binary language.
3. in machine language an instruction of adding 2 and 3 will be : 1101101010011010
which is very hard to write by human.
4. Machine language is machine dependent. Means  it differs among different types of machine.
5. All instruction written in other programing language.

Assembly language:
1. It was developed to make a programming easier.
2. It was machine dependent.
3. Keywordslike add, sub were introduced.
4. to add 2 and 3 and get the result the instruction will be: add,2,3,result.
5. "Assembler" is a program that translates assembly code with machine code.

Assembler:

High-level language:
1. It is a new generation of programing languages.
2. This language uses english words that's why it is easy to learn and easy to use.
3. this language is machine independent.
4. program will run on different machine.
5. Instructions are called "statements".
6. A program written using a high level programing language is called a 'source program' or 'source code'.

Compiler:
Compiler translates all the source code into machine code.
